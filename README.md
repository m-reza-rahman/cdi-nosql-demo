# Jakarta NoSQL with Cosmos DB

This repository shows how to use Cosmos DB with the Jakarta NoSQL specification. The repository hosts the demo for [this](abstract.md) talk.

## Setup
* Install JDK 8 (we used [Azul Zulu Java 8 LTS](https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/)).
* Install the Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers from [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/). 
* You will need a GitHub account.
* You will need an Azure subscription. If you don't have one, you can get one for free for one year [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free).
* Download this repository somewhere in your file system (easiest way might be to download as a zip and extract).
